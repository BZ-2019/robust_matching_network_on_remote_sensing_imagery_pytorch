## A Robust Matching Network for Gradually Estimating Geometric Transformation on Remote Sensing Imagery
*** Our paper has been accepted at SMC 2019!

We propose a matching network for gradually estimating the geometric transformation parameters between two aerial images taken in the same area but in different environments. To precisely matching two aerial images, there are important factors to consider such as different time, a variation of viewpoint, size, and rotation.
